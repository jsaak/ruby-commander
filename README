This is yet another GTK commander
there are a lot out there no one is perfect for me
it is unfinished but works

it is an mplayer frontend too, can play music libraries and online radios
(just copy F5) the directory to the special mplayer pane and press play

it uses FUSE such us sshfs to acces remote filesystems
